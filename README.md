# ola

Outer Loop of Agents — A harness to run long-horizon agentic loops

## Install

```bash
uv tool install .
```

## Usage

```bash
ola [-f <agent-folder>] [-a cc|oh] [-m MODEL] [-l LIMIT] [-v]
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-f, --agent-folder` | Path to the agent folder | `../agent` |
| `-a, --agent` | Agent: `cc`/`claude-code` or `oh`/`openhands` | `cc` |
| `-m, --model` | Model name | Agent default |
| `-l, --limit` | Max iterations per subfolder | No limit |
| `-v, --verbose` | Debug logging | Off |

## Agent folder structure

```
my-agent/
  01-setup/
    SEED-PROMPT.md    # Optional: runs once to generate PLAN.md
    LOOP-PROMPT.md    # Required: prompt used each iteration
    PLAN.md           # Optional: markdown todo list
    .claude/          # Claude Code config dir (auto-created by ola)
      projects/...    # conversation history auto-created by claude
    .openhands/       # OpenHands state dir (auto-created by ola)
      logs/
      trajectories/
  02-implement/
    LOOP-PROMPT.md
    PLAN.md
    .claude/
    .openhands/
```

Subfolders are processed in order. For each subfolder:

1. If `SEED-PROMPT.md` exists and `PLAN.md` does not, the seed prompt runs first to populate the plan.
2. While `PLAN.md` has unchecked tasks (`- [ ]`), the agent runs `LOOP-PROMPT.md` repeatedly.
3. Stops when all tasks are checked or the iteration limit is reached.

The agent folder must be its own git repository (ola initialises one if missing). ola commits to this repo after each seed phase and loop iteration, tracking plan progress independently from your source code.

Each agent gets a per-phase state directory (`.claude/` or `.openhands/`) inside the subfolder. For Claude Code, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set to `.claude/`, giving each phase its own conversation history that persists across sandbox sessions. For OpenHands, logs and trajectories are written to `.openhands/logs/` and `.openhands/trajectories/`.

## Docker Sandbox

Run `ola` inside a Docker sandbox using [`sbx`](https://docs.docker.com/sandbox/) (microVM-based isolation).

### Prerequisites

Set up credentials and network policy once:

```bash
# Authenticate Claude on the host (creates ~/.claude/.credentials.json via OAuth)
claude

# Set default network policy to balanced (deny-all + common dev allowlist)
sbx policy set-default balanced
```

> **Note:** We use a Claude subscription (OAuth), not an API key. The `ola-sandbox` helper copies `~/.claude/.credentials.json` from your host into the sandbox on each creation/reconnection.

### Build and push the template image

The template extends `docker/sandbox-templates:shell` and must be pushed to an OCI registry — sbx pulls templates from a registry directly and does not use the local Docker daemon's image store.

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/atineose/ola:latest --push .
```

Add `--no-cache` to force fresh installs of Claude Code, OpenHands, and ola.

### Shell helpers

Symlink `ola.sh` to your home directory and source it from `.zshrc`:

```bash
ln -sf /path/to/ola/ola.sh ~/.ola.sh
```

Add to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
[ -f ~/.ola.sh ] && source ~/.ola.sh
```

This provides **`ola-sandbox`** — creates or reconnects to a Docker sandbox.

### Run a sandbox

The expected directory layout is:

```
project/
  src/     # your source code (must be a git repo)
  agent/   # ola agent folder (git repo created by ola if missing)
```

From the `src` directory:

```bash
ola-sandbox my-sandbox
```

This will:
1. Apply project-specific network allowlist from `agent/whitelist.txt` (additive to balanced policy)
2. Create a sandbox with `src/` as primary workspace and `agent/` mounted read-only
3. Credentials are copied from host `~/.claude/.credentials.json` into the sandbox (OAuth token)

Running `ola-sandbox my-sandbox` again will reconnect to the existing sandbox.

Inside the sandbox:

```bash
ola -a cc -l 5
```

### Manual usage

If you prefer not to use the helper:

```bash
cd project/src
sbx create shell --name my-sandbox --template ghcr.io/atineose/ola:latest . ../agent:ro
sbx run my-sandbox
```

Place a `.env` file in the workspace for OpenHands env vars (`LLM_API_KEY`, etc.).

### Network policy

The `balanced` policy provides deny-by-default with allowlists for AI APIs, package managers, code hosts, and registries. To manage policies:

```bash
sbx policy ls --type network          # show active rules
sbx policy allow network "example.com,*.example.com"  # add allow rule
sbx policy log                        # view blocked requests
```

Project-specific domains can be added to `agent/whitelist.txt` (one domain per line). The `ola-sandbox` helper applies these automatically on sandbox creation.

### Laminar tracing (OpenHands only)

Set `LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY` and `LMNR_BASE_URL` in `.env` to enable trace export to [Laminar](https://www.lmnr.ai) when using the OpenHands agent (`-a oh`). Traces are exported over HTTP (OTLP/HTTP) on the port specified by `LMNR_HTTP_PORT` (default `8000`).

> **Note:** gRPC export (the default in the Laminar SDK) does not work inside Docker sandboxes. The sbx proxy downgrades HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.x, which breaks gRPC. ola uses `force_http=True` to avoid this entirely.

## ola-top

A `top`-like terminal dashboard for monitoring agent progress in real time. Shows task completion, token usage, cache hit rates, and wall time for each phase — with per-iteration drill-down.

```bash
ola-top [-f <agent-folder>] [-r <refresh-seconds>]
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-f, --agent-folder` | Path to the agent folder | `../agent` |
| `-r, --refresh` | Refresh interval in seconds | `2` |

**Keybindings:** `↑`/`↓` navigate rows, `Enter` expands/collapses a phase to show per-iteration stats, `q` quits.

Example output:

```
 ola-top — /Users/you/experiment/agent             03:42:15 PM

 # │ Folder              │ Tasks │   Input │  Output │ Cache% │  Time
 1 │ 01-setup            │   5/5 │  120.4k │   45.2k │  82.3% │  3m12s
 2 │ 02-implement        │  3/10 │   88.1k │   32.7k │  76.1% │  2m45s

 q: quit  ↑↓: navigate  Enter: expand/collapse
```

## Agents

**Claude Code** (`cc`) — calls `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p <prompt>` as a subprocess. When run via ola, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set to the phase's `.claude/` directory, giving each phase its own conversation history.

**OpenHands** (`oh`) — uses the OpenHands SDK (`LLM` + `Conversation`). Requires `LLM_API_KEY` (and optionally `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_BASE_URL`) set in the environment or a `.env` file. SDK logs and conversation trajectories are saved to `<subfolder>/.openhands/logs/` and `<subfolder>/.openhands/trajectories/`.
